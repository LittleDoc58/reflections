was introduced?

    The diff removed all identical lines allowing one to focus on just the lines
    which had changed, seeing the change that caused the problem.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
